# Fraud-Detection---Insurance-Claims
## AIM : 

**Fraud Detection Using Graphs – Neo4j**. In this project, we have to detect fraud in a real-world environment, using ML algorithms and Neo4j graph database. I am creating a python notebook that will help predict the fraud and represent it using a Neo4j database.

## What is a Fraud Detection Model? 

A fraud detection model is a ML model that helps in real-time fraud detection. Machine Learning (ML) is a set of methods and techniques that let computers recognize the patterns and trends and generate predictions based in those. Along with ML, we will also use neo4j graph database for visual representation of the model.

## Why is Machine Learning suited for Fraud Detection?

With the availability of so many methods and technologies in the market, why is ML suited for fraud detection? Lets see :

**• It is Super-Fast:** In Fraud Detection, we need results super quick, so that we don’t let the fraudster escape. ML is best suited for this.

**• Efficient and Cheap:** Running hundreds and thousands of payments calculation per second is no easy task, the human cost and time would be immense, but ML does the same in a matter of seconds.

**• More Accurate:** Machine learning models are able to learn from patterns of normal behaviour that are very hard to spot otherwise. It is quick to adapt to changes and identify fraud patterns.

**• Scalable:** In case of sudden need of resources, we can scale the ML model for new boundaries and reapply the same algorithm effectively.

## Insurance Fraud, what is it?

Insurance fraud is an illegal act on the part of either the buyer or seller of an insurance contract. Insurance fraud from the issuer includes selling policies from non-existent companies, failing to submit premiums, and churning policies to create more commissions. Buyer fraud, meanwhile, can consist of exaggerated claims, falsified medical history, post-dated policies, viatical fraud, faked death or kidnapping, and murder.

## Insurance Claims dataset

We use a dataset (insurance_claims.csv) comprising of 1000 rows, and 36 columns in the csv(comma separated values) format. We then work on the data and predict the fraudulent patterns using ML.

Before diving into Neo4j, let us see what a graph database is. A graph database stores nodes and relationships instead of tables, or documents. Data is stored just like you might sketch ideas on a whiteboard. Your data is stored without restricting it to a pre-defined model, allowing a very flexible way of thinking about and using it. 
Neo4j is a means to use a graph database and apply it to the real-world applications. Think of it as a software that helps us use graph database properly and effectively. Neo4j uses the language cypher to communicate with the data, be it in any format (i.e. .csv, .dump etc)

## Tools Used :

Following are the tools used to complete this project: 
**•	Google Colab:** It is a product from Google Research. Colab allows anybody to write and execute python code through the browser without the need to install any software or plugins. It is easy to use, efficient, and robust.
**•	Neo4j:** It is an open-source, NoSQL graph database that allows the users to store, relate, and display data in the form of graphs for better visualization and understanding. It uses the language cypher.
