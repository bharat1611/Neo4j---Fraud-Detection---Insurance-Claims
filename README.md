# Fraud-Detection---Insurance-Claims
## AIM : 

**Fraud Detection Using Graphs – Neo4j**. In this project, we have to detect fraud in a real-world environment, using ML algorithms and Neo4j graph database. I am creating a python notebook that will help predict the fraud and represent it using a Neo4j database.

## What is a Fraud Detection Model? 

A fraud detection model is a ML model that helps in real-time fraud detection. Machine Learning (ML) is a set of methods and techniques that let computers recognize the patterns and trends and generate predictions based in those. Along with ML, we will also use neo4j graph database for visual representation of the model.

## Why is Machine Learning suited for Fraud Detection?

With the availability of so many methods and technologies in the market, why is ML suited for fraud detection? Lets see :

**•It is Super-Fast:** In Fraud Detection, we need results super quick, so that we don’t let the fraudster escape. ML is best suited for this.

**•Efficient and Cheap:** Running hundreds and thousands of payments calculation per second is no easy task, the human cost and time would be immense, but ML does the same in a matter of seconds.

**•More Accurate:** Machine learning models are able to learn from patterns of normal behaviour that are very hard to spot otherwise. It is quick to adapt to changes and identify fraud patterns.

**•Scalable:** In case of sudden need of resources, we can scale the ML model for new boundaries and reapply the same algorithm effectively.
